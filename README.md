# Coverage Progression Plots Demonstrating the Effect of Grammar Transformation on Fuzzing

This repository contains auxiliary data pertaining to the "Fuzzing With Grammar Variants" master's thesis written by Mark Schuegraf.

A total of 1380 scatter plots depict the coverage progression differences of fuzzing before and after grammar transformation.

Each plot represents 250,000 data points generated by [JaCoCo-instrumented test subjects](https://github.com/havrikov/text-processing-java-projects), so considerable overlap is to be expected.
To this end, opacity is used to represent multiple occurrences of the same coverage value across different runs at the same file number.
The more transparent a data point is, the less runs produced this coverage value at that stage.
